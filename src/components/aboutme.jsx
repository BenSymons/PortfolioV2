                <p>I'm a former teacher who tried his hand at coding and ended up really enjoying it.
                When I taught, I used to handle assessment data. Grades, tests scores, things like that.
                I ended up learning how to use Excel and I was amazed at how much you can do with formulae.
                I ended up automating all sorts of things which saved me time and was very satisfying to do.
                I ended up looking into code and eventually enrolled at Northcoders where I learned everything
                I needed to become a developer. It was tough, but really enjoyable. I am now looking to start
                my new career as a web developer or a software developer and I can't wait to get started.</p>
